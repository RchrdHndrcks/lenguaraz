**Open source real-time captions and translation for conferences.**
Live audio from each stage becomes subtitles in the original language and in
Spanish, English, Portuguese, French, German or Italian, for many sessions at
once. Built for the [Nerdearla](https://nerdear.la) 2026 Vibeathon.

> *Lenguaraz*: the interpreters who mediated between languages in the history
> of the Río de la Plata.

## What it does

- One **operator page per room** captures a microphone / line-in from the
  sound desk, or plays an audio file, and streams it to the server.
- Or skip the browser: **`lenguaraz-ingest`** pulls the stage's own stream
  (SRT, RTMP, HLS, a capture card: anything ffmpeg reads) and reconnects on
  its own, so each room runs unattended for the whole event.
- Each room transcribes with Gemini's live transcription model
  (`gemini-3.5-transcribe-live`) and translates every finished sentence with a
  fast text model (`gemini-3.5-flash-lite`), keeping glossary terms intact.
- **Or run 100% local**: Whisper (whisper.cpp, Speaches…) for transcription
  and Gemma through Ollama for translation, with no Internet connection. See
  [Run it fully local](#run-it-fully-local).
- The **audience** opens `/`, picks a room and a language and reads live
  captions on their phone, or scans the room's **QR code**, which opens the
  captions in their phone's language. The same page has a **projector** mode
  (with the QR in the corner) and a transparent **OBS / vMix overlay** mode.
- **Reading settings** for accessibility: text size, light, dark and
  high-contrast colors, wider letter and line spacing (WCAG 1.4.12), and a
  bilingual mode that shows the original under each translated line. The
  page's own interface follows the caption language.
- **Transcripts per talk**: every room's transcript is split into talks, and
  each talk downloads as **VTT, SRT or TXT** with times starting at zero,
  ready to publish next to the talk's recording.
- A **production panel** shows every room's state, input audio level,
  recognizer activity, audience, latency and errors, lets the team start a
  new talk, and exports **Prometheus metrics** for alerting.
- **Printable A4 posters** with each room's QR for doors and seats.

## Quick start

Requirements: Go 1.26+ (or Docker) and a Gemini API key from
[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RchrdHndrcks/lenguaraz && cd lenguaraz
export GEMINI_API_KEY=...        # required unless you run fully local
export ADMIN_TOKEN=change-me     # protects operator and admin pages
go run ./cmd/lenguaraz           # http://localhost:8080
```

Try it without a key (scripted captions): `go run ./cmd/lenguaraz -fake`.

With Docker: `GEMINI_API_KEY=... ADMIN_TOKEN=... docker compose up --build`.
Compose refuses to start without `ADMIN_TOKEN`, so a container is never
exposed with open operator and admin pages.

The operator console captures audio with an AudioWorklet, so it needs
**Chrome or Edge** (Chromium) and a **secure context**: open it over https
(for example through your tunnel) or at `http://localhost`. Browsers block
microphone and worklet access on plain `http://<LAN-IP>`; the page says so
instead of starting. Audience pages work in any browser, over any origin.

### Try it with the bundled samples

1. Open `http://localhost:8080/operator/sala-a?token=change-me`, click the
   **en inglés** sample, then **Transmitir**.
2. Open `http://localhost:8080/operator/sala-b?token=change-me`, click the
   **en español** sample, then **Transmitir**: two sessions in parallel.
3. Open `http://localhost:8080/` and pick a room and a language.

Picking a sample also sets the console's spoken language, so either sample
works in either room.

The clips are synthetic speech from open-licensed Piper voices; see
[samples/README.md](samples/README.md) for how they were generated and the
voice licenses.

To use a real talk: download its audio (for example with
`yt-dlp -x --audio-format m4a <youtube-url>`) and choose it with the file
picker in the operator page.

## Pages and endpoints

| URL | Who | What |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | audience | rooms and languages |
| `/r/{room}?lang=es` | audience | captions on a phone (history, language switch, downloads) |
| `/r/{room}` | audience (QR) | same, in the reader's browser language |
| `/r/{room}?lang=es&mode=screen` | stage screen | last 3 lines, huge type, QR corner (`&qr=0` hides it) |
| `/r/{room}?lang=es&mode=overlay` | OBS / vMix | transparent Browser Source; `lines`, `size`, `hold` tune it: see the [OBS guide](docs/obs.md) |
| `/operator/{room}?token=…` | tech desk | audio source, spoken language, talk title, level meter, live preview |
| `/admin?token=…` | production | totals, per-room status, audio level, audience, latency, errors, new talk, exports |
| `/posters` | production | printable A4 QR poster per room (`?room=sala-a` for one) |
| `/qr/{room}` | anyone | SVG QR code that opens the room |
| `/export/{room}/{vtt,srt,txt}?lang=es` | anyone | the room's whole transcript; add `&talk=N` for one talk |
| `/api/rooms/{room}/talks` | anyone | the room's talks: number, title, start, lines, duration |
| `/metrics` | monitoring | Prometheus metrics (Bearer `ADMIN_TOKEN`) |
| `/healthz` | orchestrator | liveness probe |

## Configuration

Rooms live in `rooms.yaml`:

```yaml
rooms:
  - id: sala-a
    title: "Sala A — Keynotes"
    source: en            # language usually spoken on stage
    targets: [es, pt]     # the room's other languages
    glossary: [Nerdearla, Kubernetes, eBPF]
```

Languages are `en`, `es`, `pt`, `fr`, `de` and `it`. The room serves
`source` plus `targets`. Talks in the same room can switch language: the
operator picks the language spoken for each transmission (the console's
**Idioma que se habla** selector, or `lenguaraz-ingest -lang es`), the
recognizer is told that language, and the room's other languages become the
translations. Without a choice, the room keeps its last language.

`glossary` terms bias the transcription (custom vocabulary, or the Whisper
prompt) and are never translated.

| Env / flag | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | — | required unless `-fake` or both `ASR_URL` and `TRANSLATE_URL` are set |
| `ADMIN_TOKEN` | empty (open) | guards `/operator` streaming, `/ingest`, `/admin`, `/metrics` |
| `PUBLIC_URL` | request host | audience URL encoded in QR codes, e.g. `https://subs.example.org` |
| `ASR_URL` | — | OpenAI-compatible transcription server (`…/v1`); replaces Gemini Live |
| `ASR_MODEL` | `gemini-3.5-transcribe-live`, or `whisper-1` with `ASR_URL` | transcription model |
| `ASR_API_KEY` | — | bearer token for `ASR_URL`, if it needs one |
| `TRANSLATE_URL` | — | OpenAI-compatible chat server (`…/v1`); replaces Gemini |
| `TRANSLATE_MODEL` | `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`, or `gemma3` with `TRANSLATE_URL` | translation model |
| `TRANSLATE_API_KEY` | — | bearer token for `TRANSLATE_URL`, if it needs one |
| `-addr` | `:8080` | listen address |
| `-config` | `rooms.yaml` | rooms file |
| `-data` | `data` | transcript directory (JSONL per room) |
| `-fake` | off | scripted engines, no API calls |

## Talks and transcripts

Every caption line belongs to a talk. A room starts a new talk when:

- the operator starts a transmission with a new title (the console's
  **Charla** field, or `lenguaraz-ingest -talk "…"`);
- production clicks **Nueva charla** in the panel, which splits the talk
  without interrupting the audio (for rooms fed around the clock by
  `lenguaraz-ingest`);
- the room was idle for more than 5 minutes, so a reconnecting operator
  continues the talk but the next talk after a break starts afresh.

At the end of each talk its transcript is one click away: the audience page
offers **This talk** and **The whole room**, and
`/export/sala-a/srt?lang=es&talk=3` returns that talk alone with times that
start at zero, to load over its recording.

## Captioning a stage stream (no browser)

`lenguaraz-ingest` sends a stage's audio to its room from any machine that
can see the feed (the streaming PC, the mixer's network, a small VM). It
decodes with ffmpeg, keeps only the last 5 s while the server is unreachable
(captions resume live instead of lagging), and reconnects with backoff when
the network, the server or the source drops.

```bash
go install ./cmd/lenguaraz-ingest   # from the repo; lands in $(go env GOPATH)/bin
export LENGUARAZ_URL=https://subs.example.org ADMIN_TOKEN=change-me

lenguaraz-ingest -room sala-a -i srt://mixer.local:9000          # SRT from the mixer
lenguaraz-ingest -room sala-b -i rtmp://stream.local/live/sala-b  # RTMP feed
lenguaraz-ingest -room sala-c -i "$(yt-dlp -g -f bestaudio <url>)" # a YouTube live
lenguaraz-ingest -room sala-a -lang es -talk "eBPF" -i talk.mp4 -realtime  # a talk in Spanish, from a file
arecord -f S16_LE -r 16000 -c 1 -t raw | lenguaraz-ingest -room sala-a  # raw PCM on stdin
```

Run one per room (a systemd unit or a `tmux` pane each); the production
panel shows every room's state either way.

## Run it fully local

For venues without a reliable uplink, or events that cannot send audio to a
cloud provider, both halves of the pipeline can run on your own hardware.
Lenguaraz speaks the OpenAI-compatible APIs that local model servers expose:

```bash
# Transcription: whisper.cpp's server (or Speaches, LocalAI…)
whisper-server -m models/ggml-large-v3-turbo.bin --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 \
  --inference-path /v1/audio/transcriptions

# Translation: Gemma through Ollama (or llama.cpp's server, vLLM…)
ollama pull gemma3

ASR_URL=http://localhost:8000/v1 TRANSLATE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1 \
  ADMIN_TOKEN=change-me go run ./cmd/lenguaraz
```

With Docker Compose, point them at `http://host.docker.internal:…` instead.
You can also mix: Gemini for transcription and Gemma for translation, or the
other way around.

How the local engine works: the OpenAI transcription API takes files, not
streams, so Lenguaraz cuts the audio at the speaker's pauses (or at the
quietest moment of a long run, at most 10 s), sends each utterance as a WAV,
and transcribes the utterance in progress every 1.5 s while the server is
idle, for a live line in the original language. Captions arrive one
utterance at a time instead of word by word as with Gemini Live, and the
latency depends on your hardware: a GPU, or Apple silicon, is recommended
for `large-v3-turbo` and `gemma3` with several rooms.

## Monitoring

The production panel (`/admin`) refreshes every 2 seconds. Beyond status and
errors it shows each room's **input level** ("Silencio" when the channel is
live but quiet, "No llega" when audio stopped arriving) and **when the
recognizer last produced text**, so a muted mixer channel or a stuck
transcription is spotted before the audience notices.

For a large event, scrape `/metrics` with Prometheus
(`authorization: {credentials: <ADMIN_TOKEN>}`) and alert on, for example:

```promql
lenguaraz_room_live == 1 and lenguaraz_room_audio_level_dbfs < -50   # live but silent
time() - lenguaraz_room_last_text_timestamp_seconds > 30 and lenguaraz_room_live == 1
rate(lenguaraz_room_errors_total[5m]) > 0
```

## How it works

```
operator browser ─┐                            ┌─▶ Gemini Live, or Whisper (local)
lenguaraz-ingest ─┴─PCM 16 kHz / WebSocket──▶ room      │ interim + final text
                                               │        ▼
                                               │  translate each sentence (Gemini, or Gemma)
                                               ▼        │ one call per language
audience browsers ◀──── Server-Sent Events ─── hub ◀── store (JSONL per room)
```

- One goroutine pipeline per room; audio is billed once per room and every
  extra language is only a cheap text call.
- Gemini Live sends the utterance so far every half second. Lenguaraz
  commits a sentence as soon as later words confirm it, or once the speaker
  pauses after it, so translations do not wait for the utterance to end;
  long run-on sentences are cut at a clause boundary.
- Live sessions are rotated before their 10-minute limit, replaced when their
  transcript stalls, and reconnected with backoff; audio is buffered
  meanwhile and never blocks the operator's socket.
- Slow translations are hedged: a request that has not answered after
  1.5 s is sent again and the first answer wins.
- Slow viewers are dropped instead of slowing a room down; their browser
  reconnects and replays the last 50 lines.
- On shutdown the server waits for the lines still being translated, so
  nothing said before a restart is lost from the transcript.

## Scaling to more rooms

A single instance handles many rooms: each room is one Live session plus a
handful of goroutines, and viewers are plain SSE connections. The limits you
will hit first are the Gemini API quotas (concurrent Live sessions, requests
per minute): check them for your key and request increases for big events.

To go beyond one machine:

1. **Shard rooms across instances.** Run N copies with different
   `rooms.yaml` files and route `/r/{room}`, `/events/{room}`,
   `/ingest/{room}`, `/export/{room}` to the instance that owns the room (a
   path-based rule in any reverse proxy). No shared state is needed.
2. **Scale viewers separately.** For very large audiences, put the SSE
   fan-out behind a shared bus (Redis Pub/Sub, NATS or Google Pub/Sub): rooms
   publish segments, stateless edge instances subscribe and serve viewers.
3. **Swap models.** Transcription and translation sit behind two small Go
   interfaces (`asr.Engine`, `translate.Translator`); Gemini, Whisper and any
   OpenAI-compatible chat model already implement them.

## Accessibility and design

Captions exist for accessibility, so the interface follows public-service
design practice rather than decoration: one typeface, conventional
components, captions and body text at 7:1 contrast or more (WCAG AAA), 44 px
touch targets and a single high-visibility focus style (yellow with a dark
bar) on every theme.

- **Typeface:** [Inclusive Sans](https://github.com/LivKing/Inclusive-Sans)
  (SIL OFL), designed for legibility: it tells `I`, `l` and `1` apart and
  `0` from `O`, and stays compact enough to fit a caption line on a phone.
  It ships inside the binary, so pages make no third-party requests: the
  audience is not tracked and the site works on an isolated venue network.
- **Reader settings**, remembered per device: 4 text sizes, colors (device,
  light, dark, high contrast), wider letter and line spacing, and the
  original under each translation.
- Captions carry the right `lang` attribute so screen readers pronounce them
  in the correct language; new lines are announced through an `aria-live`
  region; the page's own text follows the caption language (ES / EN / PT /
  FR / DE / IT); motion is disabled with `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Development

```bash
go test -race ./...
go run ./cmd/lenguaraz -fake &                 # scripted engines
head -c 960000 /dev/zero | go run ./cmd/lenguaraz-ingest -room sala-a -realtime  # 30 s of fake captions
samples/make-samples.sh          # regenerate the Piper TTS samples (Docker + ffmpeg)
ffmpeg -loglevel error -i samples/en.wav -f s16le -ac 1 -ar 16000 - | \
  go run ./cmd/asr-smoke -lang en   # check the Live API from the terminal
```

The code is plain Go with the standard library wherever it can be (the
frontend is HTML, CSS and JavaScript modules with no build step, embedded in
the binary):

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `cmd/lenguaraz` | the server |
| `cmd/lenguaraz-ingest` | stream a stage's audio into a room without a browser |
| `cmd/asr-smoke` | stream PCM from stdin to Gemini Live and print the events |
| `internal/asr` | speech to text: Gemini Live, Whisper-compatible servers, a fake |
| `internal/translate` | text translation: Gemini, OpenAI-compatible chat, a fake |
| `internal/room` | one stage's pipeline, talks, status and viewer fan-out |
| `internal/web` | pages, SSE, ingest WebSocket, exports, admin API, metrics |
| `internal/store`, `internal/export` | JSONL transcripts; VTT, SRT and TXT |
