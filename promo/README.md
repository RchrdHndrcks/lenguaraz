# Lenguaraz promo video

The promo video, as code, with [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev). Every
screen in it is Lenguaraz's real interface: the audience phone is redrawn
from the viewer's own styles (so its lines can arrive live), and the stage
screen, OBS overlay, operator console and production panel are screenshots
of the running app. The music is synthesized by `make-music.py`, so the
video carries no third-party audio.

```bash
cd promo
npm install
npm run studio          # preview and edit in the browser
npm run render          # → out/lenguaraz.mp4 (1920×1080, 30 fps, ~64 s)
```

`npm run render` downloads a headless Chromium on first use; to reuse one
you already have, add `-- --browser-executable=/path/to/chrome`.

To refresh the screenshots in `public/` after a UI change (needs Go, and
Playwright's Chromium: `npx playwright install chromium`):

```bash
npm run capture
```

It builds Lenguaraz, seeds a realistic transcript (`capture/seed.mjs`),
runs the server with `-fake` and captures each page (`capture/shots.mjs`).
